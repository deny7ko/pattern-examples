### Definition

the Registry pattern (sometimes called a Service Locator) is a way for classes to look up their collaborators, rather than require they instantiate their collaborators explicitly

### When

- to enable Dependency Injection with default objects
- we can pass fake objects in tests
- we can use default objects in `rails console`

### Example

```ruby
class Registry
  def self.video_mapper
    @video_mapper ||= VideoMapper.new
  end
end

class EpisodeMapper
  def initialize(gateway, options={})
    @video_mapper = options.fetch(:video_mapper) { Registry.video_mapper }
  end
  # ...
end
```

### Bad usage

If you are writing code that will eventually be distributed outside of your app, you canâ€™t assume that the global Registry will always be present. In this case, adding attribute writers or initializer arguments to pass in collaborators (i.e. dependency injection) is a more verbose but foolproof approach.
